Contributors are obliged to disclose to the working group any knowledge they may have of existing essential patents (or an intent to patent items whenever appropriate) affecting the work covered by this repository.

Note that CTA is not responsible for identifying any patents for which a license may be required by a CTA document, nor for conducting inquiries into the legal validity or scope of those patents that are brought to its attention. For further IPR information, see Section 15 of EP-23.
